# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

It may be worth adding something to the site that would allow users to sign up for email updates from the Coffee Shop. For example, either a pop-up upon loading or something similar that encourages people to "join the community, learn about Coffee Shop events, and get a 10% off coupon".
